This is the raspberry pi port of the NCCA Graphics Library NGL, it is optimised for use with the pi and OpenGLES, for more information about the library see http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/piNGL/index.html

You need to install the following dependancies

boost++ ImageMagick and SDL this can be done on the pi using apt-get (for the wheezy image this is as follows)

apt-get install libmagick++-dev libboost-dev libsdl1.2-dev

To build on the pi just type make in the piNGL directory (and go make some coffee as it takes some time)

There is a sample cross compilation Makefile but you will need to setup the paths to suit your own installs (I copy the /opt/vc directory to my mac and use it) this will also build in the large model support which can't be compiled on the pi due to lack of memory.

Once the library is built you need to add the following line to your .bashrc file

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HOME/pingl/lib

and type source ~/.bashrc to tell the system where to find NGL.

The demos should now work (demos will be in a different download shortly)
